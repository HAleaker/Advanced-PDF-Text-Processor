This repository contains Python code designed to remove *single line* headers\/footers from PDF documents, providing a useful tool for preprocessing PDFs used in the realm of Natural Language Processing.\n\nNOTE: While this code has been developed with general needs in mind and is highly scalable - a necessity for handling the variances in PDF format - it can still be adapted for specific requirements. Contributions that enhance efficiency are always welcome!\n\nKey Features:\n\n1. Utilizes the tika library for text extraction from PDFs.\n2. Employs the Fuzzywuzzy library (under GPL v2 license) for robust calculation of string similarity, addressing the variable and possibly ambiguous nature of text extraction. \n3. Incorporates BeautifulSoup library for text extraction from the XML output of tika. \n4. Outputs text of the pdf minus *single line* headers and footers.\n5. Applies hashing for more efficient processing and memory conservation, particularly beneficial for header and footer identification in extensive text files.\n\nDependencies:\n\n1. bs4 library - MIT license \n2. fuzzywuzzy library - GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2)\n3. tika- Apache Software License\n4. Python 3.6.9\n\nThis project is licensed under the GNU General Public License, ensuring its continued availability and enhancement in the open-source community.
